## What is Art Buddy?

Created by two educators, Art Buddy is a collection of multi-sensory games and teaching tools that are designed for students with special needs. The games in this collection are either based on real IEP goals* that we've seen in our teaching careers or taken from Everyday Arts for Special Education (EASE), an experimental curriculum designed to supplement instruction with arts activities. All of the games in this collection are designed to help students reach specific goals, whether related to academics or life skills.

*IEP stands for Individualized Education Plan, which is a document written by a special education teacher that outlines a student's learning profile and goals in detail. A goal from this IEP is a specific academic or social goal that a student needs to work on (i.e. student will identify all lowercase letters in the alphabet, student will compare numbers and identify the larger/smaller number)
