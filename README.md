## What is Art Buddy?

Created by two educators, Art Buddy is a collection of multi-sensory games that are designed for students with special needs. The games in this collection are either based on real IEP goals* that we've seen in our teaching careers or taken from Everyday Arts for Special Education (EASE), an experimental curriculum designed to supplement instruction with arts activities. All of the games in this collection are designed to help students reach specific goals, whether related to academics or life skills.

*IEP stands for Individualized Education Plan, which is a document written by a special education teacher that outlines a student's learning profile and goals in detail.
